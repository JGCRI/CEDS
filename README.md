# CEDS Development
The Community Emissions Data System (CEDS) project is a data-driven, open source framework that produces annually-updated emission estimates for research and analysis. The system is written in R and uses open-source data (with the exception of the IEA energy statistics which must be purchased from IEA).

**This repository is for the continuing development of CEDS. The official, public CEDS repository can be found [here](https://github.com/JGCRI/CEDS).**

For more information about the latest features or how to contribute to CEDS, visit the [CEDS development wiki](https://github.com/JGCRI/CEDS-dev/wiki).
