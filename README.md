# CEDS
The Community Emissions Data System (CEDS) produces consistent estimates of global air emissions species over the industrial era (1750 - present). The system is written in R and uses open-source data (with the exception of the IEA energy statistics which must be purchased from IEA). CEDS is publicly available through an [Open Source License](#license-section).

***
**Pre-release Version:** June 7, 2019. The current code and data in the repository is a pre-release version. Please feel free to explore, comment on this version and send us any questions. Note that we will be pushing several updates to the system over the few weeks leading up to the first public release. These will include updates to:

* SO2, CO2, and CH4 emissions will be updated to better match the results from CMIP6 data release from Hoesly et al. (2018a). There will likely be some changes to other emission species as well.
* Updates to waste burning emissions.
* Several other updates to code and data files, including resolution of some current [open Issues](https://github.com/JGCRI/CEDS/issues).
* User guide additions.
* Description and graphs of emission differences with the CMIP6 data release

See [release notes](https://github.com/JGCRI/CEDS/wiki/Release-Notes) for change notes.

Documentation of CEDS assumptions and system operation, including a user guide, are available at the [CEDS project wiki](https://github.com/JGCRI/CEDS/wiki) and in the journal paper listed below. 

Current issues with the data or system are documented in the [CEDS Issues](https://github.com/JGCRI/CEDS/issues) system in this GitHub repository (current issues as of September 2017 are also listed in the "Known Issues" section of the Data and Assumptions wiki. Newer issues are on GitHub.). Users can submit issues using this system. These can include anomalies found in either the aggregate or gridded emissions data. Please use an appropriate tag for any submitted issues. Note that by default only unresolved issues are shown. All issues, including resolved issues, can be viewed by removing the "is:open" filter. Issues relevant for CMIP6 data releases are tagged with a “CMIP6” label (note that some of these will be closed if resolved in subsequent CEDS data releases.)

Further information can also be found at the [project web site](http://www.globalchange.umd.edu/ceds/), including a [CMIP6 page](http://www.globalchange.umd.edu/ceds/ceds-cmip6-data/) that provides details for obtaining gridded emission datasets produced by this project. 

Over the summer 2019 we will be working on a major update which will extending the time series to 2019 and update historical assumptions.

If you plan to use the CEDS data system for a research project you are encouraged to contact [Steve Smith](mailto:ssmith@pnnl.gov) so that we can coordinate with any on-going work on the CEDS system.
