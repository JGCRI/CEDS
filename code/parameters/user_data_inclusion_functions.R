# Program Name: user_data_inclusion_functions.R
# Author: Ben Goldstein, Caleb Braun
# Date Last Updated: January, 2018
# Program Purpose: Contains functions for including pre-processed user-defined
#                  energy extension data. This file focuses mainly on the
#                  functionality for the actual integration of user and default
#                  datasets, leaving the pre-processing of either for other
#                  functions.
# Functions Defined:
# Notes: See also user_extension_instr_processing.R and user_data_processing.R

# normalizeAndIncludeData
# Brief: A functions for processing user extension data. It is flexible to each aggregate
#        level. It handles normalizing data and disaggregating data based on
#        already-present percentage breakdowns.
# params:
#    Xyears: the year range of data processing
#    data_to_use: a dataframe of unchanged activity data extracted from all_activity
#    user_dataframe_subset: a subsetted dataframe of user-specified data
#    all_activity_data: the dataframe holding all activity
#    override_normalization: a manual option for disabling normalization
#    agg_level: an integer indicating the aggregate level of the data given
# 
#    TODO: Split this into many more functions

# factors of zero, so the percent breakdowns must be calculated by other means.
# Three options are tried:
#   1. Use data from other years to interpolate breakdowns:
#      If other years in the same row have non-zero values, they can be used to
#      determine the breakdowns for the years with zero values being replaced.
#      In this case, the breakdowns are linearly interpolated.
#   2. Interpolate using data from global default dataset:
#      This is done in the case that the entire row in question contains zeros.
#      In this case, the breakdowns are calculated from the default activity.
#   3. Disaggregate with equal values:
#      If the first two options didn't find values to interpolate breakdowns
#      from, just breakdown evenly across all disaggregation levels. There is
#      likely something wrong in this case, so throw a warning.
