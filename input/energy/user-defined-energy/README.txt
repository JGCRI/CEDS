This folder contains files relevant for the user-defined energy routine.

This includes:
- a sub-directory ("user_energy_input") which stores all user-defined energy 
  which is in the proper format for CEDS
- any raw data inputs not in CEDS format (along with its processing script)
- all sub-directories that are not "user_energy_input" are raw data sub-directories (e.g. "EIA-data")
