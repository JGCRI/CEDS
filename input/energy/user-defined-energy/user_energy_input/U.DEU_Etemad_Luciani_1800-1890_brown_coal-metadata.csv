Brown Coal Consumption,NA,DEU,All,1800,1859,"Etemad, B., J. Luciani, P. Bairoch, and J.-C. Toutain. 1991. World Energy Production 1800-1985. Librarie DROZ, Switzerland. Values hand transcribed from pages 20, 21, 23, 42, and 43. Brown coal values from 1801-1831 were derived by subtracting hard coal values from total coal values (as hard coal is assumed to be CEDS hard_coal and CEDS coal_coke). Brown coal and hard coal data for 1800 were determined by applying their relative amounts in 1801 to 1800. Values between years provided by Etemad et al. were determined by linearly interpolating available data. Total coal consumption from 1832-1895 was determined by summing brown coal and hard coal data."
