For the US inventory an adjustment needs to be made for many emission species to smooth out the discontinuity caused by methodology changes in 2002.

This adjustment is performed in the sheet:
	New vs Prev EPA Trends.xlsx

Unless the methodology is changed again, this does not need to be updated.

To update the inventory:

1) Replace "national_tier1_caps_no_mods.xlsx" with a new version downloaded from EPA

2) Open the above files and 

national_tier1_caps.xlsx

3) copy an additional column with formulas in national_tier1_caps.xlsx to add the additional year
