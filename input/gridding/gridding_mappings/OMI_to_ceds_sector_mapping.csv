18,Oil and Gas,Novopolotsk,Belarus,,1A1a_Electricity-public,Novopolotsk oil power plant,"Novopolotsk does have an oil refinery, which is why this may have ended up in 'Oil and Gas'. However in CEDS, majority of emissions associated with heat production, and then elec production. Almost no emissions attributed to 1B2. There is also a power plant, as commented, which uses oil and gas! But then this should be in 1A1a."

However, there are multiple oil refineries in the area, and petrochemical plants. There are some 2B emissions in CEDS in Turkey, so we will assume it's catching these sources."
