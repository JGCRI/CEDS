<h2>Is object a formula?</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>is_formula()</code> tests whether <code>x</code> is a call to <code>~</code>. <code>is_bare_formula()</code>
tests in addition that <code>x</code> does not inherit from anything else than
<code>"formula"</code>.
</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: When we first implemented <code>is_formula()</code>, we thought it
best to treat unevaluated formulas as formulas by default (see
section below). Now we think this default introduces too many edge
cases in normal code. We recommend always supplying <code>scoped = TRUE</code>. Unevaluated formulas can be handled via a <code>is_call(x, "~")</code>
branch.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
is_formula(x, scoped = NULL, lhs = NULL)

is_bare_formula(x, scoped = TRUE, lhs = NULL)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object to test.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>scoped</code></td>
<td>
<p>A boolean indicating whether the quosure is scoped,
that is, has a valid environment attribute and inherits from
<code>"formula"</code>. If <code>NULL</code>, the scope is not inspected.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>lhs</code></td>
<td>
<p>A boolean indicating whether the formula has a left-hand
side. If <code>NULL</code>, the LHS is not inspected and <code>is_formula()</code>
returns <code>TRUE</code> for both one- and two-sided formulas.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Dealing with unevaluated formulas</h3>

<p>At parse time, a formula is a simple call to <code>~</code> and it does not
have a class or an environment. Once evaluated, the <code>~</code> call
becomes a properly structured formula. Unevaluated formulas arise
by quotation, e.g. <code>~~foo</code>, <code>quote(~foo)</code>, or <code>substitute(arg)</code>
with <code>arg</code> being supplied a formula. Use the <code>scoped</code> argument to
check whether the formula carries an environment.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
is_formula(~10)
is_formula(10)

# If you don't supply `lhs`, both one-sided and two-sided formulas
# will return `TRUE`
is_formula(disp ~ am)
is_formula(~am)

# You can also specify whether you expect a LHS:
is_formula(disp ~ am, lhs = TRUE)
is_formula(disp ~ am, lhs = FALSE)
is_formula(~am, lhs = TRUE)
is_formula(~am, lhs = FALSE)

# Handling of unevaluated formulas is a bit tricky. These formulas
# are special because they don't inherit from `"formula"` and they
# don't carry an environment (they are not scoped):
f &lt;- quote(~foo)
f_env(f)

# By default unevaluated formulas are treated as formulas
is_formula(f)

# Supply `scoped = TRUE` to ensure you have an evaluated formula
is_formula(f, scoped = TRUE)

# By default unevaluated formulas not treated as bare formulas
is_bare_formula(f)

# If you supply `scoped = TRUE`, they will be considered bare
# formulas even though they don't inherit from `"formula"`
is_bare_formula(f, scoped = TRUE)
