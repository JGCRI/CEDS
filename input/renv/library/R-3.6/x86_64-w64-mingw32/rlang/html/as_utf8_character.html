<h2>Coerce to a character vector and attempt encoding conversion</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><a href="https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental"><img src="../help/figures/lifecycle-experimental.svg" alt='[Experimental]' /></a>
</p>
<p>Unlike specifying the <code>encoding</code> argument in <code>as_string()</code> and
<code>as_character()</code>, which is only declarative, these functions
actually attempt to convert the encoding of their input. There are
two possible cases:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> The string is tagged as UTF-8 or latin1, the only two encodings
for which R has specific support. In this case, converting to the
same encoding is a no-op, and converting to native always works
as expected, as long as the native encoding, the one specified by
the <code>LC_CTYPE</code> locale has support for all characters occurring in
the strings. Unrepresentable characters are serialised as unicode
points: &quot;&lt;U+xxxx&gt;&quot;.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The string is not tagged. R assumes that it is encoded in the
native encoding. Conversion to native is a no-op, and conversion
to UTF-8 should work as long as the string is actually encoded in
the locale codeset.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>When translating to UTF-8, the strings are parsed for serialised
unicode points (e.g. strings looking like &quot;U+xxxx&quot;) with
<code><a href="chr_unserialise_unicode.html">chr_unserialise_unicode()</a></code>. This helps to alleviate the effects of
character-to-symbol-to-character roundtrips on systems with
non-UTF-8 native encoding.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
as_utf8_character(x)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object to coerce.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
# Let's create a string marked as UTF-8 (which is guaranteed by the
# Unicode escaping in the string):
utf8 &lt;- "caf\uE9"
Encoding(utf8)
charToRaw(utf8)
