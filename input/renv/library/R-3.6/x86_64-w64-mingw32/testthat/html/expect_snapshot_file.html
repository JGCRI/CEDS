<h2>Snapshot testing for whole files</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Whole file snapshot testing is designed for testing objects that don't have
a convenient textual representation, with initial support for images
(<code>.png</code>, <code>.jpg</code>, <code>.svg</code>), data frames (<code>.csv</code>), and text files
(<code>.R</code>, <code>.txt</code>, <code>.json</code>, ...).
</p>
<p>The first time <code>expect_snapshot_file()</code> is run, it will create
<code style="white-space: pre;">_snaps/{test}/{name}.{ext}</code> containing reference output. Future runs will
be compared to this reference: if different, the test will fail and the new
results will be saved in <code style="white-space: pre;">_snaps/{test}/{name}.new.{ext}</code>. To review
failures, call <code><a href="snapshot_accept.html">snapshot_review()</a></code>.
</p>
<p>We generally expect this function to be used via a wrapper that takes care
of ensuring that output is as reproducible as possible, e.g. automatically
skipping tests where it's known that images can't be reproduced exactly.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
expect_snapshot_file(
  path,
  name = basename(path),
  binary = lifecycle::deprecated(),
  cran = FALSE,
  compare = NULL,
  transform = NULL,
  variant = NULL
)

announce_snapshot_file(path, name = basename(path))

compare_file_binary(old, new)

compare_file_text(old, new)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>path</code></td>
<td>
<p>Path to file to snapshot. Optional for
<code>announce_snapshot_file()</code> if <code>name</code> is supplied.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>name</code></td>
<td>
<p>Snapshot name, taken from <code>path</code> by default.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>binary</code></td>
<td>
<p><a href="https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#deprecated"><img src="../help/figures/lifecycle-deprecated.svg" alt='[Deprecated]' /></a> Please use the
<code>compare</code> argument instead.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>cran</code></td>
<td>
<p>Should these expectations be verified on CRAN? By default,
they are not, because snapshot tests tend to be fragile because they
often rely on minor details of dependencies.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>compare</code></td>
<td>
<p>A function used to compare the snapshot files. It should take
two inputs, the paths to the <code>old</code> and <code>new</code> snapshot, and return either
<code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code>. This defaults to <code>compare_file_text</code> if <code>name</code> has
extension <code>.r</code>, <code>.R</code>, <code>.Rmd</code>, <code>.md</code>, or <code>.txt</code>, and otherwise uses
<code>compare_file_binary</code>.
</p>
<p><code>compare_file_binary()</code> compares byte-by-byte and
<code>compare_file_text()</code> compares lines-by-line, ignoring
the difference between Windows and Mac/Linux line endings.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>transform</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optionally, a function to scrub sensitive or stochastic
text from the output. Should take a character vector of lines as input
and return a modified character vector as output.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>variant</code></td>
<td>
<p>If not-<code>NULL</code>, results will be saved in
<code style="white-space: pre;">_snaps/{variant}/{test}/{name}.{ext}</code>. This allows you to create
different snapshots for different scenarios, like different operating
systems or different R versions.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>old, new</code></td>
<td>
<p>Paths to old and new snapshot files.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Announcing snapshots</h3>

<p>testthat automatically detects dangling snapshots that have been
written to the <code style="white-space: pre;">_snaps</code> directory but which no longer have
corresponding R code to generate them. These dangling files are
automatically deleted so they don't clutter the snapshot
directory. However we want to preserve snapshot files when the R
code wasn't executed because of an unexpected error or because of a
<code><a href="skip.html">skip()</a></code>. Let testthat know about these files by calling
<code>announce_snapshot_file()</code> before <code>expect_snapshot_file()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>

# To use expect_snapshot_file() you'll typically need to start by writing
# a helper function that creates a file from your code, returning a path
save_png &lt;- function(code, width = 400, height = 400) {
  path &lt;- tempfile(fileext = ".png")
  png(path, width = width, height = height)
  on.exit(dev.off())
  code

  path
}
path &lt;- save_png(plot(1:5))
path

## Not run: 
expect_snapshot_file(save_png(hist(mtcars$mpg)), "plot.png")

## End(Not run)

# You'd then also provide a helper that skips tests where you can't
# be sure of producing exactly the same output
expect_snapshot_plot &lt;- function(name, code) {
  # Other packages might affect results
  skip_if_not_installed("ggplot2", "2.0.0")
  # Or maybe the output is different on some operation systems
  skip_on_os("windows")
  # You'll need to carefully think about and experiment with these skips

  name &lt;- paste0(name, ".png")

  # Announce the file before touching `code`. This way, if `code`
  # unexpectedly fails or skips, testthat will not auto-delete the
  # corresponding snapshot file.
  announce_snapshot_file(name = name)

  path &lt;- save_png(code)
  expect_snapshot_file(path, name)
}
