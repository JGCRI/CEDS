<h2>Retrieve and store git HTTPS credentials</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Low-level wrappers for the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-credential">git-credential</a>
command line tool. Try the user-friendly <a href="http_credentials.html">git_credential_ask</a>
and <a href="http_credentials.html">git_credential_update</a> functions first.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
credential_fill(cred, verbose = TRUE)

credential_approve(cred, verbose = TRUE)

credential_reject(cred, verbose = TRUE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>cred</code></td>
<td>
<p>named list with at least fields <code>protocol</code> and <code>host</code> and
optionally also <code>path</code>, <code>username</code> ,<code>password</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>emit some useful output about what is happening</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <a href="credential_api.html">credential_fill</a> function looks up credentials for a given host, and
if none exists it will attempt to prompt the user for new credentials. Upon
success it returns a list with the same <code>protocol</code> and <code>host</code> fields as the
<code>cred</code> input, and additional <code>username</code> and <code>password</code> fields.
</p>
<p>After you have tried to authenticate the provided credentials, you can report
back if the credentials were valid or not. Call <a href="credential_api.html">credential_approve</a> and
<a href="credential_api.html">credential_reject</a> with the <code>cred</code> that was returned by <a href="credential_api.html">credential_fill</a>
in order to validate or invalidate a credential from the store.
</p>
<p>Because git credential interacts with the system password manager, the appearance
of the prompts vary by OS and R frontend.  Note that <a href="credential_api.html">credential_fill</a> should
only be used interactively, because it may require the user to enter credentials
or unlock the system keychain. On the other hand <a href="credential_api.html">credential_approve</a> and
<a href="credential_api.html">credential_reject</a> are non-interactive and could be used to save or delete
credentials in a scripted program. However note that some credential helpers
(e.g. on Windows) have additional security restrictions that limit use of
<a href="credential_api.html">credential_approve</a> and <a href="credential_api.html">credential_reject</a> to credentials that were actually
entered by the user via <a href="credential_api.html">credential_fill</a>. Here it is not possible at all to
update the credential store without user interaction.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>

# Insert example cred
example &lt;- list(protocol = "https", host = "example.org",
  username = "test", password = "secret")
credential_approve(example)

# Retrieve it from the store
cred &lt;- credential_fill(list(protocol = "https", host = "example.org", path = "/foo"))
print(cred)

# Delete it
credential_reject(cred)
