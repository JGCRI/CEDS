<h2>Begin/commit/rollback SQL transactions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A transaction encapsulates several SQL statements in an atomic unit.
It is initiated with <code>dbBegin()</code> and either made persistent with <code>dbCommit()</code>
or undone with <code>dbRollback()</code>.
In any case, the DBMS guarantees that either all or none of the statements
have a permanent effect.
This helps ensuring consistency of write operations to multiple tables.
</p>



<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
dbBegin(conn, ...)

dbCommit(conn, ...)

dbRollback(conn, ...)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>conn</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <a href="DBIConnection-class.html">DBIConnection</a> object, as returned by
<code><a href="dbConnect.html">dbConnect()</a></code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Other parameters passed on to methods.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Not all database engines implement transaction management, in which case
these methods should not be implemented for the specific
<a href="DBIConnection-class.html">DBIConnection</a> subclass.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>dbBegin()</code>, <code>dbCommit()</code> and <code>dbRollback()</code> return <code>TRUE</code>, invisibly.
</p>


<h3>Failure modes</h3>

<p>The implementations are expected to raise an error in case of failure,
but this is not tested.
In any way, all generics throw an error with a closed
or invalid connection.
In addition, a call to <code>dbCommit()</code>
or <code>dbRollback()</code>
without a prior call to <code>dbBegin()</code> raises an error.
Nested transactions are not supported by DBI,
an attempt to call <code>dbBegin()</code> twice
yields an error.
</p>


<h3>Specification</h3>

<p>Actual support for transactions may vary between backends.
A transaction is initiated by a call to <code>dbBegin()</code>
and committed by a call to <code>dbCommit()</code>.
Data written in a transaction must persist after the transaction is committed.
For example, a record that is missing when the transaction is started
but is created during the transaction
must exist
both during
and after the transaction,
and also in a new connection.
</p>
<p>A transaction
can also be aborted with <code>dbRollback()</code>.
All data written in such a transaction must be removed after the
transaction is rolled back.
For example, a record that is missing when the transaction is started
but is created during the transaction
must not exist anymore after the rollback.
</p>
<p>Disconnection from a connection with an open transaction
effectively rolls back the transaction.
All data written in such a transaction must be removed after the
transaction is rolled back.
</p>
<p>The behavior is not specified if other arguments are passed to these
functions. In particular, <span class="pkg">RSQLite</span> issues named transactions
with support for nesting
if the <code>name</code> argument is set.
</p>
<p>The transaction isolation level is not specified by DBI.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
con &lt;- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), ":memory:")

dbWriteTable(con, "cash", data.frame(amount = 100))
dbWriteTable(con, "account", data.frame(amount = 2000))

# All operations are carried out as logical unit:
dbBegin(con)
withdrawal &lt;- 300
dbExecute(con, "UPDATE cash SET amount = amount + ?", list(withdrawal))
dbExecute(con, "UPDATE account SET amount = amount - ?", list(withdrawal))
dbCommit(con)

dbReadTable(con, "cash")
dbReadTable(con, "account")

# Rolling back after detecting negative value on account:
dbBegin(con)
withdrawal &lt;- 5000
dbExecute(con, "UPDATE cash SET amount = amount + ?", list(withdrawal))
dbExecute(con, "UPDATE account SET amount = amount - ?", list(withdrawal))
if (dbReadTable(con, "account")$amount &gt;= 0) {
  dbCommit(con)
} else {
  dbRollback(con)
}

dbReadTable(con, "cash")
dbReadTable(con, "account")

dbDisconnect(con)
