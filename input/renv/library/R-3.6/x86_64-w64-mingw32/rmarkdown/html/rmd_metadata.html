<h2>R Markdown Metadata</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Rmd files include a metadata section (typically located at the top of the
file) that can specify (among other things) the title, author, and date of
the document. Metadata adheres to the <a href="https://yaml.org">YAML</a> format
and is delimited by lines containing three dashes (<code>---</code>). Here is an
example metadata section:
</p>
<pre>---
title: "Crop Analysis Q3 2013"
author: Martha Smith
date: October 23rd, 2013
---
</pre>
<p>Note that the <code>title</code> field is quoted. This is because titles often
contained embedded colons (<code>:</code>) and colons followed by a space need to
be quoted in YAML.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>When title, author, and date metadata is provided it's used to
automatically create a title section within output documents. If you don't
want this section included in your document then you should remove the
corresponding metadata fields.
</p>
<p>When generating PDF and Beamer output there are also a number of other
metadata fields that can be included to customize the appearance and theme
of PDF output. For more details see the documentation for
<code><a href="pdf_document.html">pdf_document</a></code> and <code><a href="beamer_presentation.html">beamer_presentation</a></code>.
