<h2>Async Multi Download</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>AJAX style concurrent requests, possibly using HTTP/2 multiplexing.
Results are only available via callback functions. Advanced use only!
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
multi_add(handle, done = NULL, fail = NULL, data = NULL, pool = NULL)

multi_run(timeout = Inf, poll = FALSE, pool = NULL)

multi_set(total_con = 50, host_con = 6, multiplex = TRUE, pool = NULL)

multi_list(pool = NULL)

multi_cancel(handle)

new_pool(total_con = 100, host_con = 6, multiplex = TRUE)

multi_fdset(pool = NULL)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>handle</code></td>
<td>
<p>a curl <a href="handle.html">handle</a> with preconfigured <code>url</code> option.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>done</code></td>
<td>
<p>callback function for completed request. Single argument with
response data in same structure as <a href="curl_fetch.html">curl_fetch_memory</a>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>fail</code></td>
<td>
<p>callback function called on failed request. Argument contains
error message.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>(advanced) callback function, file path, or connection object for writing
incoming data. This callback should only be used for <em>streaming</em> applications,
where small pieces of incoming data get written before the request has completed. The
signature for the callback function is <code>write(data, final = FALSE)</code>. If set
to <code>NULL</code> the entire response gets buffered internally and returned by in
the <code>done</code> callback (which is usually what you want).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>pool</code></td>
<td>
<p>a multi handle created by <a href="multi.html">new_pool</a>. Default uses a global pool.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>timeout</code></td>
<td>
<p>max time in seconds to wait for results. Use <code>0</code> to poll for results without
waiting at all.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>poll</code></td>
<td>
<p>If <code>TRUE</code> then return immediately after any of the requests has completed.
May also be an integer in which case it returns after n requests have completed.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>total_con</code></td>
<td>
<p>max total concurrent connections.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>host_con</code></td>
<td>
<p>max concurrent connections per host.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>multiplex</code></td>
<td>
<p>enable HTTP/2 multiplexing if supported by host and client.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Requests are created in the usual way using a curl <a href="handle.html">handle</a> and added
to the scheduler with <a href="multi.html">multi_add</a>. This function returns immediately
and does not perform the request yet. The user needs to call <a href="multi.html">multi_run</a>
which performs all scheduled requests concurrently. It returns when all
requests have completed, or case of a <code>timeout</code> or <code>SIGINT</code> (e.g.
if the user presses <code>ESC</code> or <code>CTRL+C</code> in the console). In case of
the latter, simply call <a href="multi.html">multi_run</a> again to resume pending requests.
</p>
<p>When the request succeeded, the <code>done</code> callback gets triggered with
the response data. The structure if this data is identical to <a href="curl_fetch.html">curl_fetch_memory</a>.
When the request fails, the <code>fail</code> callback is triggered with an error
message. Note that failure here means something went wrong in performing the
request such as a connection failure, it does not check the http status code.
Just like <a href="curl_fetch.html">curl_fetch_memory</a>, the user has to implement application logic.
</p>
<p>Raising an error within a callback function stops execution of that function
but does not affect other requests.
</p>
<p>A single handle cannot be used for multiple simultaneous requests. However
it is possible to add new requests to a pool while it is running, so you
can re-use a handle within the callback of a request from that same handle.
It is up to the user to make sure the same handle is not used in concurrent
requests.
</p>
<p>The <a href="multi.html">multi_cancel</a> function can be used to cancel a pending request.
It has no effect if the request was already completed or canceled.
</p>
<p>The <a href="multi.html">multi_fdset</a> function returns the file descriptors curl is
polling currently, and also a timeout parameter, the number of
milliseconds an application should wait (at most) before proceeding. It
is equivalent to the <code>curl_multi_fdset</code> and
<code>curl_multi_timeout</code> calls. It is handy for applications that is
expecting input (or writing output) through both curl, and other file
descriptors.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
results &lt;- list()
success &lt;- function(x){
  results &lt;&lt;- append(results, list(x))
}
failure &lt;- function(str){
  cat(paste("Failed request:", str), file = stderr())
}
# This handle will take longest (3sec)
h1 &lt;- new_handle(url = "https://eu.httpbin.org/delay/3")
multi_add(h1, done = success, fail = failure)

# This handle writes data to a file
con &lt;- file("output.txt")
h2 &lt;- new_handle(url = "https://eu.httpbin.org/post", postfields = "bla bla")
multi_add(h2, done = success, fail = failure, data = con)

# This handle raises an error
h3 &lt;- new_handle(url = "https://urldoesnotexist.xyz")
multi_add(h3, done = success, fail = failure)

# Actually perform the requests
multi_run(timeout = 2)
multi_run()

# Check the file
readLines("output.txt")
unlink("output.txt")
