<h2>Access shared drives</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A shared drive supports files owned by an organization rather than an
individual user. Shared drives follow different sharing and ownership models
from a specific user's &quot;My Drive&quot;. Shared drives are the successors to the
earlier concept of Team Drives.
</p>
<p>How to capture a shared drive or files/folders that live on a
shared drive for downstream use:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code><a href="shared_drive_find.html">shared_drive_find()</a></code> and <code><a href="shared_drive_get.html">shared_drive_get()</a></code> return a <code><a href="dribble.html">dribble</a></code> with
metadata on shared drives themselves. You will need this in order to use a
shared drive in certain file operations. For example, you can specify a
shared drive as the parent folder via the <code>path</code> argument for upload, move,
copy, etc. In that context, the id of a shared drive functions like the id of
its top-level or root folder.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code><a href="drive_find.html">drive_find()</a></code> and <code><a href="drive_get.html">drive_get()</a></code> return a <code><a href="dribble.html">dribble</a></code> with metadata on
files, including folders. Both can be directed to search for files on shared
drives using the optional arguments <code>shared_drive</code> or <code>corpus</code> (documented
below).
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Regard the functions mentioned above as the official &quot;port of
entry&quot; for working with shared drives. Use these functions to capture your
target(s) in a <code><a href="dribble.html">dribble</a></code> to pass along to other googledrive functions.
The flexibility to refer to files by name or path does not apply as broadly
to shared drives. While it's always a good idea to get things into a
<code><a href="dribble.html">dribble</a></code> early, for shared drives it's often required.
</p>


<h3>Specific shared drive</h3>

<p>To search one specific shared drive, pass its name, marked id, or
<code><a href="dribble.html">dribble</a></code> to <code>shared_drive</code> somewhere in the call, like so:</p>
<pre>drive_find(..., shared_drive = "i_am_a_shared_drive_name")
drive_find(..., shared_drive = as_id("i_am_a_shared_drive_id"))
drive_find(..., shared_drive = i_am_a_shared_drive_dribble)
</pre>
<p>The value provided to <code>shared_drive</code> is pre-processed with
<code><a href="as_shared_drive.html">as_shared_drive()</a></code>.
</p>


<h3>Other collections</h3>

<p>To search other collections, pass the <code>corpus</code> parameter somewhere in the
call, like so:</p>
<pre>drive_find(..., corpus = "user")
drive_find(..., corpus = "allDrives")
drive_find(..., corpus = "domain")
</pre>
<p>Possible values of <code>corpus</code> and what they mean:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>"user"</code>: Queries files that the user has accessed, including both shared
drive and My Drive files.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"drive"</code>: Queries all items in the shared drive specified via
<code>shared_drive</code>. googledrive automatically fills this in whenever
<code>shared_drive</code> is not <code>NULL</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"allDrives"</code>: Queries files that the user has accessed and all shared
drives in which they are a member. Note that the response may include
<code>incompleteSearch : true</code>, indicating that some corpora were not searched
for this request (currently, googledrive does not surface this). Prefer
<code>"user"</code> or <code>"drive"</code> to <code>"allDrives"</code> for efficiency.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"domain"</code>: Queries files that are shared to the domain, including both
shared drive and My Drive files.
</p>
</li></ul>

<h3>API docs</h3>

<p>googledrive implements shared drive support as outlined here:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/enable-shareddrives">https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/enable-shareddrives</a>
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Users shouldn't need to know any of this, but here are details for the
curious. The extra information needed to search shared drives consists of the
following query parameters:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>corpora</code>: Where to search? Formed from googledrive's <code>corpus</code> argument.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>driveId</code>: The id of a specific shared drive. Only allowed &ndash; and also
absolutely required &ndash; when <code>corpora = "drive"</code>. When user specifies a
<code>shared_drive</code>, googledrive sends its id and also infers that <code>corpora</code>
should be set to <code>"drive"</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>includeItemsFromAllDrives</code>: Do you want to see shared drive items?
Obviously, this should be <code>TRUE</code> and googledrive sends this whenever shared
drive parameters are detected.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>supportsAllDrives</code>: Does the sending application (googledrive, in this
case) know about shared drive? Obviously, this should be <code>TRUE</code> and
googledrive sends it for all applicable endpoints, all the time.
</p>
</li></ul>
