<h2>Run <code>R CMD check</code> on the reverse dependencies of a package</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Install the source package, figure out the reverse dependencies on CRAN,
download all of their source packages, and run <code>R CMD check</code> on them
in parallel.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
rev_check(
  pkg,
  which = "all",
  recheck = NULL,
  ignore = NULL,
  update = TRUE,
  timeout = getOption("xfun.rev_check.timeout", 15 * 60),
  src = file.path(src_dir, pkg),
  src_dir = getOption("xfun.rev_check.src_dir")
)

compare_Rcheck(status_only = TRUE, output = "00check_diffs.md")
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>pkg</code></td>
<td>
<p>The package name.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>which</code></td>
<td>
<p>Which types of reverse dependencies to check. See
<code>tools::<a href="../../tools/html/package_dependencies.html">package_dependencies</a>()</code> for possible values. The
special value <code>'hard'</code> means the hard dependencies, i.e.,
<code>c('Depends', 'Imports', 'LinkingTo')</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>recheck</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of package names to be (re)checked. If not provided
and there are any &lsquo;<span class="file">*.Rcheck</span>&rsquo; directories left by certain packages
(this often means these packages failed the last time), <code>recheck</code> will
be these packages; if there are no &lsquo;<span class="file">*.Rcheck</span>&rsquo; directories but a text
file &lsquo;<span class="file">recheck</span>&rsquo; exists, <code>recheck</code> will be the character vector
read from this file. This provides a way for you to manually specify the
packages to be checked. If there are no packages to be rechecked, all
reverse dependencies will be checked.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ignore</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of package names to be ignored in <code>R CMD
check</code>. If this argument is missing and a file &lsquo;<span class="file">00ignore</span>&rsquo; exists, the
file will be read as a character vector and passed to this argument.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>update</code></td>
<td>
<p>Whether to update all packages before the check.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>timeout</code></td>
<td>
<p>Timeout in seconds for <code>R CMD check</code> to check each
package. The (approximate) total time can be limited by the global option
<code>xfun.rev_check.timeout_total</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>src</code></td>
<td>
<p>The path of the source package directory.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>src_dir</code></td>
<td>
<p>The parent directory of the source package directory. This can
be set in a global option if all your source packages are under a common
parent directory.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>status_only</code></td>
<td>
<p>If <code>TRUE</code>, only compare the final statuses of the
checks (the last line of &lsquo;<span class="file">00check.log</span>&rsquo;), and delete &lsquo;<span class="file">*.Rcheck</span>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<span class="file">*.Rcheck2</span>&rsquo; if the statuses are identical, otherwise write out the
full diffs of the logs. If <code>FALSE</code>, compare the full logs under
&lsquo;<span class="file">*.Rcheck</span>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<span class="file">*.Rcheck2</span>&rsquo;.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>output</code></td>
<td>
<p>The output Markdown file to which the diffs in check logs will
be written. If the <span class="pkg">markdown</span> package is available, the Markdown file
will be converted to HTML, so you can see the diffs more clearly.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Everything occurs under the current working directory, and you are
recommended to call this function under a designated directory, especially
when the number of reverse dependencies is large, because all source packages
will be downloaded to this directory, and all &lsquo;<span class="file">*.Rcheck</span>&rsquo; directories
will be generated under this directory, too.
</p>
<p>If a source tarball of the expected version has been downloaded before (under
the &lsquo;<span class="file">tarball</span>&rsquo; directory), it will not be downloaded again (to save time
and bandwidth).
</p>
<p>After a package has been checked, the associated &lsquo;<span class="file">*.Rcheck</span>&rsquo; directory
will be deleted if the check was successful (no warnings or errors or notes),
which means if you see a &lsquo;<span class="file">*.Rcheck</span>&rsquo; directory, it means the check
failed, and you need to take a look at the log files under that directory.
</p>
<p>The time to finish the check is recorded for each package. As the check goes
on, the total remaining time will be roughly estimated via <code>n *
mean(times)</code>, where <code>n</code> is the number of packages remaining to be
checked, and <code>times</code> is a vector of elapsed time of packages that have
been checked.
</p>
<p>If a check on a reverse dependency failed, its &lsquo;<span class="file">*.Rcheck</span>&rsquo; directory will
be renamed to &lsquo;<span class="file">*.Rcheck2</span>&rsquo;, and another check will be run against the
CRAN version of the package unless <code>options(xfun.rev_check.compare =
FALSE)</code> is set. If the logs of the two checks are the same, it means no new
problems were introduced in the package, and you can probably ignore this
particular reverse dependency. The function <code>compare_Rcheck()</code> can be
used to create a summary of all the differences in the check logs under
&lsquo;<span class="file">*.Rcheck</span>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<span class="file">*.Rcheck2</span>&rsquo;. This will be done automatically if
<code>options(xfun.rev_check.summary = TRUE)</code> has been set.
</p>
<p>A recommended workflow is to use a special directory to run
<code>rev_check()</code>, set the global <code><a href="../../base/html/options.html">options</a></code>
<code>xfun.rev_check.src_dir</code> and <code>repos</code> in the R startup (see
<code>?<a href="../../base/html/Startup.html">Startup</a></code>) profile file <code>.Rprofile</code> under this directory,
and (optionally) set <code>R_LIBS_USER</code> in &lsquo;<span class="file">.Renviron</span>&rsquo; to use a special
library path (so that your usual library will not be cluttered). Then run
<code>xfun::rev_check(pkg)</code> once, investigate and fix the problems or (if you
believe it was not your fault) ignore broken packages in the file
&lsquo;<span class="file">00ignore</span>&rsquo;, and run <code>xfun::rev_check(pkg)</code> again to recheck the
failed packages. Repeat this process until all &lsquo;<span class="file">*.Rcheck</span>&rsquo; directories
are gone.
</p>
<p>As an example, I set <code>options(repos = c(CRAN =
'https://cran.rstudio.com'), xfun.rev_check.src_dir = '~/Dropbox/repo')</code> in
&lsquo;<span class="file">.Rprofile</span>&rsquo;, and <code>R_LIBS_USER=~/R-tmp</code> in &lsquo;<span class="file">.Renviron</span>&rsquo;. Then I
can run, for example, <code>xfun::rev_check('knitr')</code> repeatedly under a
special directory &lsquo;<span class="file">~/Downloads/revcheck</span>&rsquo;. Reverse dependencies and their
dependencies will be installed to &lsquo;<span class="file">~/R-tmp</span>&rsquo;, and <span class="pkg">knitr</span> will be
installed from &lsquo;<span class="file">~/Dropbox/repo/kintr</span>&rsquo;.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A named numeric vector with the names being package names of reverse
dependencies; <code>0</code> indicates check success, <code>1</code> indicates failure,
and <code>2</code> indicates that a package was not checked due to global
timeout.
</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p><code>devtools::revdep_check()</code> is more sophisticated, but currently
has a few major issues that affect me: (1) It always deletes the
&lsquo;<span class="file">*.Rcheck</span>&rsquo; directories
(<a href="https://github.com/r-lib/devtools/issues/1395">https://github.com/r-lib/devtools/issues/1395</a>), which makes it
difficult to know more information about the failures; (2) It does not
fully install the source package before checking its reverse dependencies
(<a href="https://github.com/r-lib/devtools/pull/1397">https://github.com/r-lib/devtools/pull/1397</a>); (3) I feel it is
fairly difficult to iterate the check (ignore the successful packages and
only check the failed packages); by comparison, <code>xfun::rev_check()</code>
only requires you to run a short command repeatedly (failed packages are
indicated by the existing &lsquo;<span class="file">*.Rcheck</span>&rsquo; directories, and automatically
checked again the next time).
</p>
<p><code>xfun::rev_check()</code> borrowed a very nice feature from
<code>devtools::revdep_check()</code>: estimating and displaying the remaining
time. This is particularly useful for packages with huge numbers of reverse
dependencies.
