<h2>Get a token for an external account</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><a href="https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental"><img src="../help/figures/lifecycle-experimental.svg" alt='[Experimental]' /></a>
Workload identity federation is a new (as of April 2021) keyless
authentication mechanism that allows applications running on a non-Google
Cloud platform, such as AWS, to access Google Cloud resources without using a
conventional service account token. This eliminates the dilemma of how to
safely manage service account credential files.
</p>
<p>Unlike service accounts, the configuration file for workload identity
federation contains no secrets. Instead, it holds non-sensitive metadata.
The external application obtains the needed sensitive data &quot;on-the-fly&quot; from
the running instance. The combined data is then used to obtain a so-called
subject token from the external identity provider, such as AWS. This is then
sent to Google's Security Token Service API, in exchange for a very
short-lived federated access token. Finally, the federated access token is
sent to Google's Service Account Credentials API, in exchange for a
short-lived GCP access token. This access token allows the external
application to impersonate a service account and inherit the permissions of
the service account to access GCP resources.
</p>
<p>This feature is still experimental in gargle and <strong>currently only supports
AWS</strong>. It also requires installation of the suggested packages
<span class="pkg">aws.signature</span> and <span class="pkg">aws.ec2metadata</span>. Workload identity federation
<strong>can</strong> be used with other platforms, such as Microsoft Azure or any
identity provider that supports OpenID Connect. If you would like gargle to
support this token flow for additional platforms, please <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/gargle/issues">open an issue on GitHub</a> and describe your use case.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
credentials_external_account(
  scopes = "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform",
  path = "",
  ...
)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>scopes</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector of scopes to request. Pick from those listed
at <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes">https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes</a>.
</p>
<p>For certain token flows, the
<code>"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email"</code> scope is unconditionally
included. This grants permission to retrieve the email address associated
with a token; gargle uses this to index cached OAuth tokens. This grants no
permission to view or send email and is generally considered a low-value
scope.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>path</code></td>
<td>
<p>JSON containing the workload identity configuration for the
external account, in one of the forms supported for the <code>txt</code> argument of
<code><a href="../../jsonlite/html/fromJSON.html">jsonlite::fromJSON()</a></code> (probably, a file path, although it could be a JSON
string). The instructions for generating this configuration are given at
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/access-resources-aws#generate">Automatically generate credentials</a>.
</p>
<p>Note that external account tokens are a natural fit for use as Application
Default Credentials, so consider storing the configuration file in one of
the standard locations consulted for ADC, instead of providing <code>path</code>
explicitly. See <code><a href="credentials_app_default.html">credentials_app_default()</a></code> for more.</p>

<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Additional arguments passed to all credential functions.</p>
