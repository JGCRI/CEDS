                        processes are cleaned up in tests

ps                      Process table

ps_children             List of child processes (process objects) of
                        the process. Note that this typically requires
                        enumerating all processes on the system, so it
                        is a costly operation.
ps_cmdline              Command line of the process
ps_connections          List network connections of a process
ps_cpu_count            Number of logical or physical CPUs

                        absolute path.
ps_descent              Query the ancestry of a process
ps_disk_partitions      List all mounted partitions
ps_disk_usage           Disk usage statistics, per partition
ps_environ              Environment variables of a process
ps_exe                  Full path of the executable of a process
ps_handle               Create a process handle
ps_interrupt            Interrupt a process
ps_is_running           Checks whether a process is running
ps_kill                 Kill a process
ps_loadavg              Return the average system load over the last 1,
                        5 and 15 minutes as a tuple. The “load”
                        represents the processes which are in a
                        runnable state, either using the CPU or waiting
                        to use the CPU (e.g. waiting for disk I/O). On
                        Windows this is emulated by using a Windows API
                        that spawns a thread which keeps running in
                        background and updates results every 5 seconds,
                        mimicking the UNIX behavior. Thus, on Windows,
                        the first time this is called and for the next
                        5 seconds it will return a meaningless (0.0,
                        0.0, 0.0) vector. The numbers returned only
                        make sense if related to the number of CPU
                        cores installed on the system. So, for
                        instance, a value of 3.14 on a system with 10
                        logical CPUs means that the system load was
                        31.4% percent over the last N minutes.
