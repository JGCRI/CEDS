<h2>Normalize CSI and OSC Sequences</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Re-encodes SGR and OSC encoded URL sequences into a unique decomposed form.
Strings containing semantically identical SGR and OSC sequences that are
encoded differently should compare equal after normalization.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
normalize_state(
  x,
  warn = getOption("fansi.warn", TRUE),
  term.cap = getOption("fansi.term.cap", dflt_term_cap()),
  carry = getOption("fansi.carry", FALSE)
)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector or object that can be coerced to such.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>warn</code></td>
<td>
<p>TRUE (default) or FALSE, whether to warn when potentially
problematic <em>Control Sequences</em> are encountered.  These could cause the
assumptions <code>fansi</code> makes about how strings are rendered on your display
to be incorrect, for example by moving the cursor (see <code><a href="fansi.html">?fansi</a></code>).
At most one warning will be issued per element in each input vector.  Will
also warn about some badly encoded UTF-8 strings, but a lack of UTF-8
warnings is not a guarantee of correct encoding (use <code><a href="../../base/html/validUTF8.html">validUTF8</a></code> for
that).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>term.cap</code></td>
<td>
<p>character a vector of the capabilities of the terminal, can
be any combination of &quot;bright&quot; (SGR codes 90-97, 100-107), &quot;256&quot; (SGR codes
starting with &quot;38;5&quot; or &quot;48;5&quot;), &quot;truecolor&quot; (SGR codes starting with
&quot;38;2&quot; or &quot;48;2&quot;), and &quot;all&quot;. &quot;all&quot; behaves as it does for the <code>ctl</code>
parameter: &quot;all&quot; combined with any other value means all terminal
capabilities except that one.  <code>fansi</code> will warn if it encounters SGR codes
that exceed the terminal capabilities specified (see <code><a href="term_cap_test.html">term_cap_test</a></code>
for details).  In versions prior to 1.0, <code>fansi</code> would also skip exceeding
SGRs entirely instead of interpreting them.  You may add the string &quot;old&quot;
to any otherwise valid <code>term.cap</code> spec to restore the pre 1.0 behavior.
&quot;old&quot; will not interact with &quot;all&quot; the way other valid values for this
parameter do.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>carry</code></td>
<td>
<p>TRUE, FALSE (default), or a scalar string, controls whether to
interpret the character vector as a &quot;single document&quot; (TRUE or string) or
as independent elements (FALSE).  In &quot;single document&quot; mode, active state
at the end of an input element is considered active at the beginning of the
next vector element, simulating what happens with a document with active
state at the end of a line.  If FALSE each vector element is interpreted as
if there were no active state when it begins.  If character, then the
active state at the end of the <code>carry</code> string is carried into the first
element of <code>x</code> (see &quot;Replacement Functions&quot; for differences there).  The
carried state is injected in the interstice between an imaginary zeroeth
character and the first character of a vector element.  See the &quot;Position
Semantics&quot; section of <code><a href="substr_ctl.html">substr_ctl</a></code> and the &quot;State Interactions&quot; section
of <code><a href="fansi.html">?fansi</a></code> for details.  Except for <code><a href="strwrap_ctl.html">strwrap_ctl</a></code> where <code>NA</code> is
treated as the string <code>"NA"</code>, <code>carry</code> will cause <code>NA</code>s in inputs to
propagate through the remaining vector elements.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Each compound SGR sequence is broken up into individual tokens, superfluous
tokens are removed, and the SGR reset sequence &quot;ESC[0m&quot; (or &quot;ESC[m&quot;)
is replaced by the closing codes for whatever SGR styles are active at the
point in the string in which it appears.
</p>
<p>Unrecognized SGR codes will be dropped from the output with a warning.  The
specific order of SGR codes associated with any given SGR sequence is not
guaranteed to remain the same across different versions of <code>fansi</code>, but
should remain unchanged except for the addition of previously uninterpreted
codes to the list of interpretable codes.  There is no special significance
to the order the SGR codes are emitted in other than it should be consistent
for any given SGR state.  URLs adjacent to SGR codes are always emitted after
the SGR codes irrespective of what side they were on originally.
</p>
<p>OSC encoded URL sequences are always terminated by &quot;ESC]\&quot;, and those
between abutting URLs are omitted.  Identical abutting URLs are merged.  In
order for URLs to be considered identical both the URL and the &quot;id&quot; parameter
must be specified and be the same.  OSC URL parameters other than &quot;id&quot; are
dropped with a warning.
</p>
<p>The underlying assumption is that each element in the vector is
unaffected by SGR or OSC URLs in any other element or elsewhere.  This may
lead to surprising outcomes if these assumptions are untrue (see examples).
You may adjust this assumption with the <code>carry</code> parameter.
</p>
<p>Normalization was implemented primarily for better compatibility with
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=crayon"><code>crayon</code></a> which emits SGR codes individually and assumes that each
opening code is paired up with its specific closing code, but it can also be
used to reduce the probability that strings processed with future versions of
<code>fansi</code> will produce different results than the current version.

<h3>Examples</h3>

normalize_state("hello\033[42;33m world\033[m")
normalize_state("\033[4mhello\033[42;33m world\033[m")

## Superflous codes removed
normalize_state("\033[31;32mhello\033[m")      # only last color prevails
normalize_state("\033[31\033[32mhello\033[m")  # only last color prevails
normalize_state("\033[31mhe\033[49mllo\033[m") # unused closing

## Equivalent normalized sequences compare identical
identical(
  normalize_state("\033[31;32mhello\033[m"),
  normalize_state("\033[31mhe\033[49mllo\033[m")
