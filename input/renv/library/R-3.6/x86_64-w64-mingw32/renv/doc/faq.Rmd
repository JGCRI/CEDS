## Why isn't my package being snapshotted into the lockfile?

By default, `renv` uses the intersection of:

1. Packages installed into your project library, and

2. Packages which appear to be used in your project, as discovered by
   `renv::dependencies()`,

in determining which packages should enter the lockfile. The intention is that
only the packages you truly require for your project should enter the lockfile;
development dependencies (e.g. `devtools`) normally should not.

If you find a package is not entering the lockfile, you can check the output of:

```
renv::dependencies()
```

and see whether usages of your package are reported in the output.

Note that `renv`'s dependency discovery machinery relies on static analysis of
your R code, and does not understand all of the different ways in which a
package might be used in a project. For example, `renv` will detect the
following usages:

```r
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

But it will be unable to detect these kinds of usages:

```r
for (package in c("dplyr", "ggplot2")) {
  library(package, character.only = TRUE)
}
```

If you use a custom package loader in your project that `renv` could feasibly
support, please feel free to [file a feature request](https://github.com/rstudio/renv/issues).

If you'd instead prefer to capture _all_ packages installed into your project
library (and eschew dependency discovery altogether), you can instead use
`"simple"` snapshots. Configure your project to use `"simple"` snapshots with:

```
renv::settings$snapshot.type("simple")
```

Packages can also be explicitly ignored through a project setting, e.g. with:

```
renv::settings$ignored.packages("<package>")
```

You might also want to double-check the set of ignored packages
(`renv::settings$ignored.packages()`) and confirm that you aren't
unintentionally ignoring a package you actually require.

See the documentation in `?snapshot` for more details.


## How should I handle development dependencies?

This is related to the above question: by design, `renv.lock` normally only
captures build-time or deploy-time dependencies; it may not capture the packages
that you use in iterative workflows (e.g. `devtools`). However, you may want
some way of still ensuring these development dependencies get installed when
trying to restore a project library.

For cases like these, we recommend tracking these packages in a project
DESCRIPTION file; typically, within the `Suggests:` field. Then, you can
execute:

```
renv::install()
```

to request that `renv` install the packages as described in the DESCRIPTION
file. In addition, the `Remotes:` fields will be parsed and used, to ensure
packages are installed from their declared remote source as appropriate.
