When you want to share a project with other collaborators, you may want to
ensure everyone is working with the same environment -- otherwise, code in the
project may unexpectedly fail to run because of changes in behavior between
different versions of the packages in use. You can use `renv` to help make
this possible.


## Collaborating with renv

When using `renv`, the packages used in your project will be recorded into a
lockfile, `renv.lock`. Because `renv.lock` records the exact versions of R
packages used within a project, if you share that file with your collaborators,
they will be able to use `renv::restore()` to install exactly the same R
packages as recorded in the lockfile. This implies the following workflow for
collaboration:

1. Select a way to share your project sources. The most common way nowadays is
   to use a version control system with a public repository; e.g.
   [git](https://git-scm.com/) with [GitHub](https://github.com/), but
   many other options are available.

2. Make sure your project is initialized with `renv` by calling `renv::init()`.

3. Share your project sources, alongside the generated lockfile `renv.lock`.

After your collaborators have received your `renv.lock` lockfile, they can then
also execute `renv::init()` (or `renv::restore()`) to automatically install
the packages declared in that lockfile into their own private project library.
By doing this, they will now be able to work within your project using the
exact same R packages that you were when `renv.lock` was generated.

## Updating the Lockfile

While working on a project, you or your collaborators may need to update or
install new packages in your project. The workflow remains the same as before --
after installing these new packages, you can share the updated lockfile with
your collaborators, and request that they execute `renv::restore()` to
synchronize their library with the lockfile.

A bit of care needs to be taken if your collaborators attempt to update packages
independently. It is recommended that a single 'source of truth' is used for the
package sources and `renv.lock`, to avoid different collaborators ending up with
different lockfiles -- or even, different versions of the project sources!

The simplest way to guard against this it to use a version control system, and
have all collaborators work off the same branch. This way, if someone needs to
update `renv.lock` in the public repository, all collaborators will see that
updated lockfile and will gain access to it next time they pull those changes.
Depending on the size of your team, you may want to ensure any changes to
`renv.lock` are communicated so that everyone knows and understands when and
why packages have been installed or updated.
