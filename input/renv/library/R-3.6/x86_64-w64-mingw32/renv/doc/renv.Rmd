The `renv` package is a new effort to bring project-local R dependency
management to your projects. The goal is for `renv` to be a robust, stable
replacement for the [Packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/) package, with
fewer surprises and better default behaviors.

Underlying the philosophy of `renv` is that any of your existing workflows
should just work as they did before -- `renv` helps manage library paths (and
other project-specific state) to help isolate your project's R dependencies,
and the existing tools you've used for managing R packages (e.g.
`install.packages()`, `remove.packages()`) should work as they did before.


## Workflow

The general workflow when working with `renv` is:

1. Call `renv::init()` to initialize a new project-local environment with a
   private R library,

2. Work in the project as normal, installing and removing new R packages as
   they are needed in the project,

3. Call `renv::snapshot()` to save the state of the project library to the
   lockfile (called `renv.lock`),

4. Continue working on your project, installing and updating R packages as
   needed.

5. Call `renv::snapshot()` again to save the state of your project library if
   your attempts to update R packages were successful, or call `renv::restore()`
   to revert to the previous state as encoded in the lockfile if your attempts
   to update packages introduced some new problems.

The `renv::init()` function attempts to ensure the newly-created project
library includes all R packages currently used by the project. It does this
by crawling R files within the project for dependencies with the
`renv::dependencies()` function. The discovered packages are then installed
into the project library with the `renv::hydrate()` function, which will also
attempt to save time by copying packages from your user library (rather than
re-installing from CRAN) as appropriate.

Calling `renv::init()` will also write out the infrastructure necessary to
automatically load and use the private library for new R sessions launched
from the project root directory. This is accomplished by creating (or amending)
a project-local `.Rprofile` with the necessary code to load the project when
the R session is started.

If you'd like to initialize a project without attempting dependency discovery
and installation -- that is, you'd prefer to manually install the packages
your project requires on your own -- you can use `renv::init(bare = TRUE)`
to initialize a project with an empty project library.


## Reproducibility

Using `renv`, it's possible to "save" and "load" the state of your project
library. More specifically, you can use:

- `renv::snapshot()` to save the state of your project to `renv.lock`; and
  
- `renv::restore()` to restore the state of your project from `renv.lock`.

For each package used in your project, `renv` will record the package version,
and (if known) the external source from which that package can be retrieved.
`renv::restore()` uses that information to retrieve and re-install those
packages in your project.

Be aware that `renv::restore()` may fail if a package was originally installed
through a CRAN-available binary, but that binary is no longer available. `renv`
will attempt to install the package from sources in this situation, but attempts
to install from source can (and often do) fail due to missing system
prerequisites for compilation of a package. The `renv::equip()` function may be
useful -- it will download external software commonly used when compiling R
packages from sources, and instruct R to use that software during compilation.


## Infrastructure

The following files are written to and used by projects using `renv`:

| **File**          | **Usage**                                                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.Rprofile`       | Used to activate `renv` for new R sessions launched in the project.                 |
| `renv.lock`       | The lockfile, describing the state of your project's library at some point in time. |
| `renv/activate.R` | The activation script run by the project `.Rprofile`.                               |
| `renv/library`    | The private project library.                                                        |

In particular, `renv/activate.R` ensures that the project library is made active
for newly launched R sessions. This ensures that any new R processes launched
within the project directory will use the project library, and hence are
isolated from the regular user library.
 
For development and collaboration, the `.Rprofile`, `renv.lock` and
`renv/activate.R` files should be committed to your version control system; the
`renv/library` directory should normally be ignored. Note that `renv::init()`
will attempt to write the requisite ignore statements to the project
`.gitignore`.


## Upgrading renv

After initializing a project with `renv`, that project will then be 'bound'
to the particular version of `renv` that was used to initialize the project.
If you need to upgrade (or otherwise change) the version of `renv` associated
with a project, you can use `renv::upgrade()`. This will install the latest
version of the `renv` 

With each commit of `renv`, we bump the package version and also tag the
commit with the associated package version. This implies that you can call,
for example:

```
renv::upgrade(version = "`r renv:::renv_package_version("renv")`")
```

to request the installation of that particular version of `renv` if so required.


## Cache

One of `renv`'s primary features is the use of a global package cache, which is
shared across all projects using `renv`. The `renv` package cache provides
two primary benefits:

1. Future calls to `renv::restore()` and `renv::install()` will become much
   faster, as `renv` will be able to find and re-use packages already installed
   in the cache.

2. Because it is not necessary to have duplicate versions of your packages
   installed in each project, the `renv` cache should also help you save
   disk space relative to an approach with project-specific libraries without
   a global cache.

To understand the `renv` cache, we need to first understand what an R _library_
is. An R library is, normally, a directory of installed R packages which can be
loaded and used within an R session. These are the directories reported by e.g.
`.libPaths()`, and R uses these directories when searching for packages to
load (e.g. in response to a call to `library(dplyr)`).

When using `renv` with the global package cache, the project library is instead
formed as a directory of symlinks (or, on Windows, junction points) into the
`renv` global package cache. Hence, while each `renv` project is isolated from
other projects on your system, they can still re-use the same installed packages
as required.

In some cases, `renv` will be unable to directly link from the global package
cache to your project library -- for example, if the package cache and your
project library live on different disk volumes. In such a case, `renv` will
instead copy the package from the cache into the project library.

By default, `renv` generates its cache in the following folders:

| **Platform** | **Location**                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Linux        | `~/.local/share/renv`                |
| macOS        | `~/Library/Application Support/renv` |
| Windows      | `%LOCALAPPDATA%/renv`                |

If you'd like to share the package cache across multiple users, you can do so by
setting the `RENV_PATHS_CACHE` environment variable to a shared path. This
variable can be set in an R startup file to make it apply to all R sessions.
For example, it could be set within:

- A project-local `.Renviron`;
- The user-level `~/.Renviron`;
- A site-wide file at `$(R RHOME)/etc/Renviron.site`.

You may also want to set `RENV_PATHS_CACHE` so that the global package cache can
be stored on the same volume as the projects you normally work on. This is
especially important when working projects stored on a networked filesystem.

While we recommend enabling the cache by default, if you're having trouble with
`renv` when the cache is enabled, it can be disabled by setting the project
setting `renv::settings$use.cache(FALSE)`. Doing this will ensure that packages
are then installed into your project library directly, without attempting to
link and use packages from the `renv` cache.

If you find a problematic package has entered the cache (for example, an
installed package has become corrupted), that package can be removed with the
`renv::purge()` function. See the `?purge` documentation for caveats and things
to be aware of when removing packages from the cache.


## Installation from Source

In the end, `renv` still needs to install R packages -- either from binaries
available from CRAN, or from sources when binaries are not available.
Installation from source can be challenging for a few reasons:

1. Your system will need to have a compatible compiler toolchain available.
   In some cases, R packages may depend on C / C++ features that aren't
   available in an older system toolchain, especially in some older Linux
   enterprise environments.

2. Your system will need requisite system libraries, as many R packages contain
   compiled C / C++ code that depend on and link to these packages.

## Downloads

By default, `renv` uses [`curl`](https://curl.haxx.se/) for file downloads
when available. This allows `renv` to support a number of download features
across multiple versions of R, including:

- Custom headers (used especially for authentication),
- Connection timeouts,
- Download retries on transient errors.

If `curl` is not available on your machine, it is highly recommended that you
install it. Newer versions of Windows 10 come with a bundled version of
`curl.exe`; other users on Windows can use `renv::equip()` to download and
install a recent copy of `curl`. Newer versions of macOS come with a bundled
version of `curl` that is adequate for usage with `renv`, and most Linux package
managers have a modern version of `curl` available in their repositories.

`curl` downloads can be configured through `renv`'s configuration settings --
see `?renv::config` for more details.


### Proxies

If your downloads need to go through a proxy server, then there are a variety of
approaches you can take to make this work:

1. Set the `http_proxy` and / or `https_proxy` environment variables. These
   environment variables can contain the full URL to your proxy server,
   including a username + password if necessary.

2. You can use a `.curlrc` (`_curlrc` on Windows) to provide information about
   the proxy server to be used. This file should be placed in your home folder
   (see `Sys.getenv("HOME")`, or `Sys.getenv("R_USER")` on Windows);
   alternatively, you can set the `CURL_HOME` environment variable to point
   to a custom 'home' folder to be used by `curl` when resolving the runtime
   configuration file. On Windows, you can also place your `_curlrc` in the
   same directory where the `curl.exe` binary is located.

See the curl documentation on [proxies](https://ec.haxx.se/usingcurl-proxies.html)
and [config files](https://ec.haxx.se/cmdline-configfile.html) for more details.

As an [example](https://github.com/rstudio/renv/issues/146), the following
`_curlrc` works when using authentication with NTLM and SSPI on Windows:

```
--proxy "your.proxy.dns:port"
--proxy-ntlm
--proxy-user ":"
--insecure
```

The [curl](https://cran.r-project.org/package=curl) R package also has a helper:

```
curl::ie_get_proxy_for_url()
```

which may be useful when attempting to discover this proxy address.


## Authentication

Your project may make use of packages which are available from remote sources
requiring some form of authentication to access -- for example, a GitHub
enterprise server. Usually, either a personal access token (PAT) or username
+ password combination is required for authentication. `renv` is able to
authenticate when downloading from such sources, using the same system as the
[remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes) package.
In particular, environment variables are used to record and transfer the
required authentication information.

| **Remote Source** | **Authentication**                      |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| GitHub            | `GITHUB_PAT`                            |
| GitLab            | `GITLAB_PAT`                            |
| Bitbucket         | `BITBUCKET_USER` + `BITBUCKET_PASSWORD` |
| Git Remotes       | `GIT_PAT` / `GIT_USER` + `GIT_PASSWORD` |

These credentials can be stored in e.g. `.Renviron`, or can be set in your R
session through other means as appropriate.

If you require custom authentication for different packages (for example, your
project makes use of packages available on different GitHub enterprise servers),
you can use the `renv.auth` R option to provide package-specific authentication
settings. `renv.auth` can either be a a named list associating package names
with environment variables, or a function accepting a package name + record, and
returning a list of environment variables. For example:

```r
# define a function providing authentication
options(renv.auth = function(package, record) {
  if (package == "MyPackage")
    return(list(GITHUB_PAT = "<pat>"))
})

# use a named list directly
options(renv.auth = list(
  MyPackage = list(GITHUB_PAT = "<pat>")
))

# alternatively, set package-specific option
options(renv.auth.MyPackage = list(GITHUB_PAT = "<pat>"))
```

For packages installed from Git remotes, `renv` will attempt to use `git` from
the command line to download and restore the associated package. Hence, it is
recommended that authentication is done through SSH keys when possible.


## Shims

To help you take advantage of the package cache, `renv` places a couple of
shims on the search path:

| **Function**         | **Shim**          |
| -------------------- | ----------------- |
| `install.packages()` | `renv::install()` |
| `remove.packages()`  | `renv::remove()`  |
| `update.packages()`  | `renv::update()`  |

This can be useful when installing packages which have already been cached.
For example, if you use `renv::install("dplyr")`, and `renv` detects that
the latest version on CRAN has already been cached, then `renv` will just
install using the copy available in the cache -- thereby skipping some of
the installation overhead.

If you'd prefer not to use the `renv` shims, they can be disabled by setting
the option `options(renv.config.shims.enabled = FALSE)`. See `?config`
for more details.


## History

If you're using a version control system with your project, then as you call
`renv::snapshot()` and later commit new lockfiles to your repository, you may
find it necessary later to recover older versions of your lockfiles. `renv`
provides the functions `renv::history()` to list previous revisions of your
lockfile, and `renv::revert()` to recover these older lockfiles.

Currently, only Git repositories are supported by `renv::history()` and
`renv::revert()`.


## Comparison with Packrat

`renv` differs from Packrat in the following ways:

1. The `renv` lockfile `renv.lock` is formatted as [JSON](https://www.json.org/).
   This should make the lockfile easier to use and consume with other tools.

2. `renv` no longer attempts to explicitly download and track R package source
   tarballs within your project. This was a frustrating default that operated
   under the assumption that you might later want to be able to restore a
   project's private library without access to a CRAN repository. In practice,
   this is almost never the case, and the time spent downloading + storing the
   package sources seemed to outweigh the potential reproducibility benefits.

3. Packrat tried to maintain the distinction between so-called 'stale' packages;
   that is, R packages which were installed by Packrat but were not recorded
   in the lockfile for some reason. This distinction was (1) overall not useful,
   and (2) confusing. `renv` no longer makes this distinction:
   `snapshot()` saves the state of your project library to `renv.lock`,
   `restore()` loads the state of your project library from `renv.lock`, and
   that's all.

4. In `renv`, the global package cache is enabled by default. This should
   reduce overall disk-space usage as packages can effectively be shared
   across each project using `renv`.

5. `renv`'s dependency discovery machinery is more configurable. The function
   `renv::dependencies()` is exported, and users can create `.renvignore` files
   to instruct `renv` to ignore specific files and folders in their projects.
   (See `?renv::dependencies` for more information.)


## Migrating from Packrat

The `renv::migrate()` function makes it possible to migrate projects from
Packrat to `renv`. See the `?migrate` documentation for more details. In
essence, calling `renv::migrate("<project path>")` will be enough to
migrate the Packrat library and lockfile such that they can then be
used by `renv`.


## Future Work

`renv`, like Packrat, is designed to work standalone without the need to
depend on any non-base R packages. However, the following (future) integrations
are planned:

- Use [pak](https://github.com/r-lib/pak) for parallel package installation,

- Use [sysreqsdb](https://github.com/r-hub/sysreqsdb) to validate and install
  system dependencies as required before attempting to install the associated
  packages.

These integrations will be optional (so that `renv` can always work standalone)
but we hope that they will further improve the speed and reliability of `renv`.
