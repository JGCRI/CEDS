Sulfur content,SO2,all,Shipping,2000,2017,"Third IMO GHG Study 2014 (MEPC-67-6-INF3-2014); IMO - Sulphur monitoring - various years; Fourth IMO GHG Study 2020 (MEPC 75-7-15); IMO Sulphur monitoring. Heavy oil S% adjusted before 2009 for mass/sample weighted bias. Distillate S% assumed to linearly approach 5000 ppm by 1990; ramping down to IMO estimated levels after 2911. 2020 forward estimates based on fraction of fuel oil reported to be in compliance (as reported by Diamond et al. 2023 doi: 10.5194/acp-23-8259-2023) + estimate of number of ships with scrubbers (Osipova etal 2021,Hermansson etal 2024) .
