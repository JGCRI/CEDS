"Note: Throughout the rest of this Inventory, medium-duty trucks are grouped with heavy-duty trucks; they are reported separately here because these two categories may run on a slightly different range of fuel types.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 2015, EIA changed its methods for estimating AFV fuel consumption. These methodological changes included how vehicle counts are estimated, moving from estimates based on modeling to one that is based on survey data. EIA now publishes data about fuel use and number of vehicles for only four types of AFV fleets: federal government, state government, transit agencies, and fuel providers. These changes were first incorporated in the 2014 Inventory and apply to the 1990 to 2016 time period. This resulted in large reductions in AFV VMT, thus leading to a shift in VMT to conventional on-road vehicle classes. In 2016, estimates of alternative fuel vehicle mileage for the last ten years were revised to reflect updates made to EIA data on alternative fuel use and vehicle counts. These changes were first incorporated in this year’s Inventory and apply to the 2005 to 2016 time period. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
