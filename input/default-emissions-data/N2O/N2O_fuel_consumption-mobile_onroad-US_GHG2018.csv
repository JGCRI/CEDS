"a In 2011, FHWA changed its methodology for Table VM-1, which impacts estimates for the 2007 to 2016 time period. These methodological changes include how on-road vehicles are classified, moving from a system based on body-type to one that is based on wheelbase. This resulted in large changes in fuel consumption data by vehicle class between 2006 and 2007. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"b Figures do not include ethanol blended in motor gasoline or biodiesel blended into distillate fuel oil. Net carbon fluxes associated with ethanol are accounted for in the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry chapter. This table is calculated with the heat content for gasoline without ethanol (from Table A.2 in the EIA Annual Energy Review) rather than the annually variable quantity-weighted heat content for gasoline with ethanol, which varies by year. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"c Gasoline and diesel highway vehicle fuel consumption estimates are based on data from FHWA Highway Statistics Table MF-21, MF-27, and VM-1 (FHWA 1996 through 2017). Data from Table VM-1 is used to estimate the share of consumption between each on-road vehicle class. These fuel consumption estimates are combined with estimates of fuel shares by vehicle type from DOE’s TEDB Annex Tables A.1 through A.6 (DOE 1993 through 2017). TEDB data for 2016 has not been published yet, therefore 2015 data are used as a proxy. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
d Fluctuations in recreational boat gasoline estimates reflect the use of this category to reconcile bottom-up values with EIA total gasoline estimates.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"e Class II and Class III diesel consumption data for 2014 to 2016 is not available, therefore 2013 data are used as a proxy. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"f Estimated based on EIA transportation sector energy estimates by fuel type, with bottom-up activity data used for apportionment to modes. Transportation sector natural gas and LPG consumption are based on data from EIA (2017a). In previous Inventory years, data from DOE TEDB was used to estimate each vehicle class’s share of the total natural gas and LPG consumption. Since TEDB does not include estimates for natural gas use by medium and heavy duty trucks or LPG use by passenger cars, EIA Alternative Fuel Vehicle Data (Browning 2017) is now used to determine each vehicle class’s share of the total natural gas and LPG consumption. These changes were first incorporated in this year’s Inventory and apply to the 1990 through 2016 time period.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
