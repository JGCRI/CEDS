a See Annex 3.2 for definitions of on-road vehicle types. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"b Gasoline and diesel highway vehicle mileage estimates are based on data from FHWA Highway Statistics Table VM-1 (FHWA 1996 through 2017). These mileage estimates are combined with estimates of fuel shares by vehicle type from DOE’s TEDB Annex Tables A.1 through A.6 (DOE 1993 through 2016). TEDB data for 2016 has not been published yet, therefore 2015 data are used as a proxy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"c Rail emissions do not include emissions from electric powered locomotives. Class II and Class III rail diesel consumption for 2014-2016 are not available, therefore 2013 data is used as a proxy. Commuter and intercity rail diesel consumption data for 2016 is not available yet, therefore 2015 data are used as a proxy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"d Includes equipment, such as tractors and combines, as well as fuel consumption from trucks that are used off-road in agriculture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"e Includes equipment, such as cranes, dumpers, and excavators, as well as fuel consumption from trucks that are used off-road in construction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"f “Other” includes snowmobiles and other recreational equipment, logging equipment, lawn and garden equipment, railroad equipment, airport equipment, commercial equipment, and industrial equipment, as well as fuel consumption from trucks that are used off-road for commercial/industrial purposes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note: In 2011, FHWA changed its methods for estimating vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and related data. These methodological changes included how vehicles are classified, moving from a system based on body type to one that is based on wheelbase. These changes were first incorporated for the 1990 through 2010 Inventory and apply to the 2007 through 2016 time period. This resulted in large changes in VMT and fuel consumption data by vehicle class, thus leading to a shift in emissions among on-road vehicle classes. Totals may not sum due to independent rounding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
